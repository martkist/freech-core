Building freech

***************************************************************
*** THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE - THE BUILD SYSTEM IS UNFINISHED ***
***************************************************************

This software is a proof-of-concept, a forced marriage between
bitcoin and libtorrent codebases. So don't expect an easy ride.
Building this thing is quite hacky (but hopefully not complicated).

1) Freech relies on a bundled custom version of libtorrent, so
first you need to build that:

$ cd libtorrent
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure --enable-logging --enable-debug --enable-dht
$ make

Note1: 64-bit systems may need eg. "--with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib64"
       or "--with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/"
Note2: disable logging if you want, but at this point it might
       help to diagnose problems in case anything goes wrong.

2) Then, for bitcoin/freech, you have actually two choices to
build. Both will produce (almost) the same "freechd" executable,
so try which one works for you.

2a) Using qmake

$ qmake
$ make

2b) Using standard makefile

$ cd src
$ make -f makefile.unix


DEPENDENCIES
